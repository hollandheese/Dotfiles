This is part of the [[file:starter-kit.org][Emacs Starter Kit]].

* Starter Kit Org
Configuration for the eminently useful [[http://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]].

Org-mode is for keeping notes, maintaining ToDo lists, doing project
planning, and authoring with a fast and effective plain-text system.
Org Mode can be used as a very simple folding outliner or as a complex
GTD system or tool for reproducible research and literate programming.

For more information on org-mode check out [[http://orgmode.org/worg/][worg]], a large Org-mode wiki
which is also implemented using Org-mode and [[http://git-scm.com/][git]].

** Exporter Settings and Helpful Packages
HTML and LaTeX exporters are shown by default. We add the Markdown exporter to the menu.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

;; Autocomplete for orgmode
(require 'org-ac)
(org-ac/config-default)

;; Markdown exporter
(require 'ox-md)

(setq org-completion-use-ido t)
;; (require 'org-special-blocks)
;; (if window-system (require 'org-mouse))

;; Compatibility with WindMove
;; Make windmove work in org-mode:
(add-hook 'org-shiftup-final-hook 'windmove-up)
(add-hook 'org-shiftleft-final-hook 'windmove-left)
(add-hook 'org-shiftdown-final-hook 'windmove-down)

** COMMENT Org-Mode Hooks
Make yasnippet work properly with org-mode. 

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;;  (defun yas/org-very-safe-expand ()
;;    (let ((yas/fallback-behavior 'return-nil)) (yas/expand)))

(defun yas-org-very-safe-expand ()
  (let ((yas-fallback-behavior 'return-nil))
    (and (fboundp 'yas-expand) (yas-expand))))

(add-hook 'org-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
            (add-to-list 'org-tab-first-hook
                         'yas-org-very-safe-expand)
            ))

** Speed keys
Speed commands enable single-letter commands in Org-mode files when
the point is at the beginning of a headline, or at the beginning of a
code block.

See the =org-speed-commands-default= variable for a list of the keys
and commands enabled at the beginning of headlines.  All code blocks
are available at the beginning of a code block, the following key
sequence =C-c C-v h= (bound to =org-babel-describe-bindings=) will
display a list of the code blocks commands and their related keys.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-use-speed-commands t)
#+end_src

** Code blocks
This activates a number of widely used languages, you are encouraged
to activate more languages using the customize interface for the
=org-babel-load-languages= variable, or with an elisp form like the
one below.  The customize interface of =org-babel-load-languages=
contains an up to date list of the currently supported languages.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (org-babel-do-load-languages
   'org-babel-load-languages
   '((emacs-lisp . t)
     (sh . t)
     (R . t)
     (perl . t)
     (ruby . t)
     (python . t)
     (js . t)
     (haskell . t)))
#+end_src

The next block makes org-babel aware that a lower-case 'r' in a =src= block header should be processed as R. 

#+source: add-r
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (add-to-list 'org-src-lang-modes
                 '("r" . ess-mode))
#+end_src

** Code block fontification
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: code-block-fontification
   :END:

The following displays the contents of code blocks in Org-mode files
using the major-mode of the code.  It also changes the behavior of
=TAB= to as if it were used in the appropriate major mode.  This means
that reading and editing code form inside of your Org-mode files is
much more like reading and editing of code using its major mode.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-src-fontify-natively t)
  (setq org-src-tab-acts-natively t)
#+end_src

Don't ask for confirmation on every =C-c C-c= code-block compile. 

#+source: turn-off-code-block-confirm
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil)
#+end_src

** Ensure the Latest Org-mode manual is in the info directory
By placing the =doc/= directory in Org-mode at the front of the
=Info-directory-list= we can be sure that the latest version of the
Org-mode manual is available to the =info= command (bound to =C-h i=).
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (unless (boundp 'Info-directory-list)
    (setq Info-directory-list Info-default-directory-list))
  (setq Info-directory-list
        (cons (expand-file-name
               "doc"
               (expand-file-name
                "org"
                (expand-file-name "src" dotfiles-dir)))
              Info-directory-list))
#+end_src

** Nice Bulleted Lists
#+name: org-bullets
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
  (require 'org-bullets)
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda () (org-bullets-mode 1)))
#+end_src

#+source: message-line
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (message "Starter Kit Org loaded.")
#+end_src
