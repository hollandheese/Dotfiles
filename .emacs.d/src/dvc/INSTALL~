THE VERY QUICK INSTALLATION GUIDE
=================================

Since nobody reads long documentation, here's a very short
installation guide:

$ cd dvc/
$ mkdir ++build/
$ cd ++build/
$ ../configure
$ make
[ possibly make install ]

And add

(load-file "/path/to/dvc/++build/dvc-load.el")

to your ~/.emacs.el

For the details, see below.


USING CONFIGURE
===============

0) If you get DVC from the revision control, the ./configure script is
   not included. You have to run "autoreconf" or "autoconf" to recreate it.

1) Select your emacs flavor, this is the option --with-emacs and its
   default is emacs (GNU Emacs).  Choose a prefix for the installation
   with --prefix, by default /usr/local.

   The default locations are as follows:

   a) GNU Emacs: lisp files goto ${prefix}/share/emacs/site-lisp and
      info files to ${prefix}/info (overridable with --with-lispdir=...
      and --infodir=...)

   b) XEmacs: lisp files goto ${prefix}/lib/xemacs/site-packages/lisp/xtla and info
      files to ${prefix}/lib/xemacs/site-packages/info, (overridable
      with --with-infodir=... and --infodir=...)

   ATTENTION: Files byte-compiled with GNU Emacs are NOT COMPATIBLE with the
   XEmacs and you may experience strange problems during startup when doing
   so.  Thus ensure you are configuring with --with-emacs=xemacs when
   installing DVC for XEmacs!

   a) GNU Emacs users run:
	./configure

   b) XEmacs users run:
	./configure --with-emacs=xemacs

   It is possible to build DVC in a separate directory. For instance, type

        mkdir emacs_build; cd emacs_build;
          ../configure --with-emacs=emacs

2) Compile the lisp files and info by running:
	make

3) Installing the files

   Run the following command:
	make install

   a) The easy way

       The files dvc.el generated in the build directory and in
       the install directory do everything for you: Manually, you can
       run

         M-x load-file RET /path/to/dvc-load.el RET

       (usefull when you want to load DVC after starting "emacs -q"!),
       or add

         (load-file "/path/to/this/file/in/builddir/dvc-load.el")

       to your ~/.emacs.el


      The manual way

       GNU Emacs: Put the lisp/info path as chosen above into your load-path,
       i.e. add the following to your ~/.emacs.el (if you don't already have an
       equivalent)
         (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/lisp/build/dir")
         (add-to-list 'Info-default-directory-list "/path/to/the/info/dir"))

       Now, GNU Emacs knows where to find DVC, tell it to load it, by adding
         (require 'dvc-autoloads)
       to your ~/.emacs.el.


   b) XEmacs: You are lucky nothing to do for you!

   That's it! Restart Emacs and read the info or start using DVC. For
   example, look at the DVC submenu in the Tools menu.

4) Integration of Xtla with Gnus

   If you use Gnus and Xtla (support for tla and baz in DVC), you
   probably want to add

     (tla-insinuate-gnus)

   to your ~/.gnus.el

INSTALLING BY HAND (for GNU Emacs)
==================

Basically you need to copy all the *.el files into a directory that is listed
in your `load-path' and the info file into a directory listed in your
`Info-directory-list'.

Then perform the steps from 3a) in the last section.

NOTES
=====

- XEmacs users will require the file ewoc.el which is also installed in the
  package dir. It's provided in the contrib/ directory of DVC.
- xtla-browse.el is an add-on package for xtla.el. xtla-browse.el requires
  tree-widget.el 2.0 or higher written by David Ponce.  XEmacs users should
  install the "jde" package.  GNU Emacs in subversions.gnu.org CVS repository
  contains tree-widget.el. If you are using older GNU Emacs or XEmacs, you can
  get it from http://sourceforge.net/projects/emhacks/.  xtla.el doesn't
  require xtla-browse.el. xtla-browse.el is an option.
